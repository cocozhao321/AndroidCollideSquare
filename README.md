# AndroidCollideSquare

To play this game, you need to move the green square on the screen and try your best to not
collide with any black blocks. You will get five points when each blocks disappear on the 
screen, and will die once you collide with any black blocks.

your computer runs too slow. Try to reopen (most of time no need to reinstall) the app and 
wait for few seconds.
